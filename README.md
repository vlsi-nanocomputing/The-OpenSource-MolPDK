# The OpenSource MolPDK
The Open Source Molecular Field-Coupled Nanocomputing (MolFCN) Physical Design Kit, managed by the [Quantum and Nanosystem (QNANO)](https://www.vlsilab.polito.it/) at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), provides a set of PDKs for the Molecular Field-Coupled (MolFCN) technology.

## Libraries

Here listed all the PDKs listed in the  Open Source Molecular Field-Coupled Nanocomputing (MolFCN) Physical Design Kit:

[**MolPDK-SIM(7):**](https://github.com/vlsi-nanocomputing/SIM7/) 4 logic devices (AND, OR, Majority Voter, and Inverter) and 3 connections (bus, L, and T). Validated through SCERPA simulation on an ideal molecule. Standard gate: 400 nm² subdivided in a 10 x 10 grid of 2 nm² MolFCN cells, intermolecular distance fixed to 1 nm. Compatible with Fiction and SCERPA-based tools.
